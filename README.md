# Developer Stances

The [Developer Stances] are "Developer" archetypes created to enable better conversations about behavior.

First developed by [Mark Stapper] in 2024, this repository tracks and enables further development of the stances by the broader Agile community.

## Done

* Developer Stances Trading Cards
* Becoming the stances through improv: facilitation plan Lite (As seen on [SFConference 2024])

## Future Plans

* Incorporate feedback on v0.1 of the trading cards
* Add Developer Stances Trading Cards source files
* Add existing articles on Developer behavior
* Write articles detailing each of the Developer stances
* [maybe] Write a full facilitation guide for the improv workshop
* [maybe] Do a kickstarter for printing v0.2 of the trading cards
* [maybe] Get original artwork to allow commercial use

## Contributing
